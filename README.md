# RedFetch
![RedFetch Logo](/images/redfetch.png "RedFetch Logo")

I made this as a way of understanding the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and loading images after initially loading a thumbnail image.

## Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dayvidwhy/redfetch.git
cd redfetch
# open the index.html file
```

This project does not use any build tools, it is just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so you just have to open the included HTML file and the project will load.

## About
There are other reddit image viewers out there that offer more functionality, but I found that all I wanted to do was browse through the images, so I made something that does just that. 

It seems faster than other sites so far and performs well on mobile.

I also make use of debouncing to prevent browser lag when the page is scrolled and scrolling to the bottom allows for more images to be loaded.
